#  Chords Database

For my [Chord Provider](https://github.com/Desbeers/Chord-Provider) application, I use my [SwiftlyChordUtilities](https://github.com/Desbeers/SwiftlyChordUtilities) package.
It has a database with all the known chords.

This macOS Ventura and iPadOS 16 application shows all those chords.

## The database is not perfect and I wrote this application to view and alter them

- A new file will start with a default database.
- You can save your altered database in the *SwiftlyChordUtilities* format.
- And you can open it again.

## Limitations

- It will not find all chords
- It has some dificulties with 'slash' chords like 'C/E' especialy when the 'slash' is not part of the chord.
